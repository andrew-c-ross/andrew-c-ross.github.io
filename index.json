In this study, we use a machine learning model to assess the predictability of column minimum dissolved oxygen in Chesapeake Bay at a monthly time scale. Compared to previous models for dissolved oxygen and hypoxia, our model has the advantages of resolving spatial variability and fitting more flexible relationships between dissolved oxygen and the predictor variables. Using a concise set of predictors with established relationships with dissolved oxygen, we find that dissolved oxygen in a given month can be skillfully predicted with knowledge of stratification and mean temperature during the same month. Furthermore, the predictions generated by the model are consistent with expectations from prior knowledge and basic physics. The model reveals that accurate knowledge or skillful forecasts of the vertical density gradient is the key to successful prediction of dissolved oxygen, and prediction skill disappears if stratification is only known at the beginning of the forecast. The lost skill cannot be recovered by replacing stratification as a predictor with variables that have a lagged correlation with stratification (such as river discharge); however, skill is obtainable in many cases if stratification can be forecast with an error of less than about 1 kg m−3. Thus, future research on hypoxia forecasting should focus on understanding and forecasting variations in stratification over subseasonal time scales (between about two weeks and two months).","tags":null,"title":"An assessment of the predictability of column minimum dissolved oxygen concentrations in Chesapeake Bay using a machine learning model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nasrin Alamdari","David J Sample","Jia Liu","Andrew Ross"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514782800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514782800,"objectID":"5f70f9be80424a908e2df7656c7e12d2","permalink":"https://andrew-c-ross.github.io/publication/alamdari-2018-assessing/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/alamdari-2018-assessing/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Assessing climate change impacts on the reliability of rainwater harvesting systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Moges B Wagena","Amy S Collick","Andrew C Ross","Raymond G Najjar","Benjamin Rau","Andrew R Sommerlot","Daniel R Fuka","Peter JA Kleinman","Zachary M Easton"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514782800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514782800,"objectID":"8a0d62ac88ac88b4cee87b2e863f85c5","permalink":"https://andrew-c-ross.github.io/publication/wagena-2018-impact/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/wagena-2018-impact/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Impact of climate change and climate anomalies on hydrologic and biogeochemical processes in an agricultural catchment of the Chesapeake Bay watershed, USA","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Darrell J Bosch","Moges B Wagena","Andrew C Ross","Amy S Collick","Zachary M Easton"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514782800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514782800,"objectID":"8d0eb13e31e4e3dde0f58eebec735905","permalink":"https://andrew-c-ross.github.io/publication/bosch-2018-meeting/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/bosch-2018-meeting/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Meeting Water Quality Goals under Climate Change in Chesapeake Bay Watershed, USA","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nasrin Alamdari","David J Sample","Jia Liu","Andrew Ross"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514782800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514782800,"objectID":"a00098dde269de556451082100a7bb6d","permalink":"https://andrew-c-ross.github.io/publication/alamdari-2018-water/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/alamdari-2018-water/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Water supply and runoff capture reliability curves for hypothetical rainwater harvesting systems for locations across the US for historical and projected climate conditions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nasrin Alamdari","David J Sample","Peter Steinberg","Andrew C Ross","Zachary M Easton"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483246800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483246800,"objectID":"0c855aca5bbceacc74808d46663d8177","permalink":"https://andrew-c-ross.github.io/publication/alamdari-2017-assessing/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/alamdari-2017-assessing/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Assessing the Effects of Climate Change on Water Quantity and Quality in an Urban Watershed Using a Calibrated Stormwater Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrew C Ross","Raymond G Najjar","Ming Li","Serena Blyth Lee","Fan Zhang","Wei Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483246800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483246800,"objectID":"2e60a0a1c0d51f5e977a2ff19e07f373","permalink":"https://andrew-c-ross.github.io/publication/ross-2017-fingerprints/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ross-2017-fingerprints/","section":"publication","summary":"Secular tidal trends are present in many tide gauge records, but their causes are often unclear. This study examines trends in tides over the last century in the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays. Statistical models show negative M2 amplitude trends at the mouths of both bays, while some upstream locations have insignificant or positive trends. To determine whether sea level rise is responsible for these trends, we include a term for mean sea level in the statistical models and compare the results with predictions from numerical and analytical models. The observed and predicted sensitivities of M2 amplitude and phase to mean sea level are similar, although the numerical model amplitude is less sensitive to sea level. The sensitivity occurs as a result of strengthening and shifting of the amphidromic system in the Chesapeake Bay and decreasing frictional effects and increasing convergence in the Delaware Bay. After accounting for the effect of sea level, significant negative background M2 and S2 amplitude trends are present; these trends may be related to other factors such as dredging, tide gauge errors, or river discharge. Projected changes in tidal amplitudes due to sea level rise over the 21st century are substantial in some areas, but depend significantly on modeling assumptions.","tags":null,"title":"Fingerprints of Sea Level Rise on Changing Tides in the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fan Zhang","Ming Li","Andrew C Ross","Serena Blyth Lee","Da-Lin Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483246800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483246800,"objectID":"93dff955b926be392ef1290b90685b53","permalink":"https://andrew-c-ross.github.io/publication/zhang-2017-sensitivity/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/zhang-2017-sensitivity/","section":"publication","summary":"Through a case study of Hurricane Arthur (2014), the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model and the Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) are used to investigate the sensitivity of storm surge forecasts to physics parameterizations and configurations of the initial and boundary conditions in WRF. The turbulence closure scheme in the planetary boundary layer affects the prediction of the storm intensity: the local closure scheme produces lower equivalent potential temperature than the nonlocal closure schemes, leading to significant reductions in the maximum surface wind speed and surge heights. On the other hand, higher-class cloud microphysics schemes overpredict the wind speed, resulting in large overpredictions of storm surge at some coastal locations. Without cumulus parameterization in the outermost domain, both the wind speed and storm surge are grossly underpredicted as a result of large precipitation decreases in the storm center. None of the choices for the WRF physics parameterization schemes significantly affect the prediction of Arthur’s track. Sea surface temperature affects the latent heat release from the ocean surface and thus storm intensity and storm surge predictions. The large-scale atmospheric circulation models provide the initial and boundary conditions for WRF, and influence both the track and intensity predictions, thereby changing the spatial distribution of storm surge along the coastline. These sensitivity analyses underline the need to use an ensemble modeling approach to improve the storm surge forecasts.","tags":null,"title":"Sensitivity Analysis of Hurricane Arthur (2014) Storm Surge Forecasts to WRF Physics Parameterizations and Model Configurations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xuan Yu","Gopal Bhatt","Christopher J Duffy","Denice H Wardrop","Raymond G Najjar","Andrew C Ross","Matthew Rydzik"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420088400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420088400,"objectID":"f74915e912c8822057a03d37edf53a75","permalink":"https://andrew-c-ross.github.io/publication/yu-2015-coupled/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/yu-2015-coupled/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A coupled surface subsurface modeling framework to assess the impact of climate change on freshwater wetlands","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrew C Ross","Raymond G Najjar","Ming Li","Michael E Mann","Susan E Ford","Brandon Katz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420088400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420088400,"objectID":"8a544ca9fb5cc2814a5b5c35e2885a87","permalink":"https://andrew-c-ross.github.io/publication/ross-2015-sea/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ross-2015-sea/","section":"publication","summary":"The response of salinity in the Delaware Estuary to climatic variations is determined using statistical models and long-term (1950-present) records of salinity from the U.S. Geological Survey and the Haskin Shellfish Research Laboratory. The statistical models include non-parametric terms and are robust against autocorrelated and heteroscedastic errors. After using the models to adjust for the influence of streamflow and seasonal effects on salinity, several locations in the estuary show significant upward trends in salinity. Insignificant trends are found at locations that are normally upstream of the salt front. The models indicate a positive correlation between rising sea levels and increasing residual salinity, with salinity rising from 2.5 to 4.4 per meter of sea-level rise. These results are consistent with results from 1D and dynamical models. Wind stress also appears to play some role in driving salinity variations, consistent with its effect on vertical mixing and Ekman transport between the estuary and the ocean. The results suggest that continued sea-level rise in the future will cause salinity to increase regardless of any change in streamflow.","tags":null,"title":"Sea-level rise and other influences on decadal-scale salinity variability in a coastal plain estuary","type":"publication"}]
